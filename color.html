    <h1>Jenkins User Documentation</h1>
<h2>Welcome to the Jenkins user documentation - for people wanting to use Jenkinsâ€™s existing functionality and plugin features.
</h2>
<p>Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, 
  and delivering or deploying software.Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, 
  Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed</p>
<h2> Installing Jenkins </h2>
<p>The procedures in this chapter are for new installations of Jenkins.
Jenkins is typically run as a standalone application in its own process.
  The Jenkins WAR file bundles Winstone, a Jetty servlet container wrapper, 
  and can be started on any operating system or platform with a version of Java supported by Jenkins.
  Theoretically, Jenkins can also be run as a servlet in a traditional servlet container like Apache Tomcat or WildFly, 
  but in practice this is largely untested and there are many caveats. In particular, support for WebSocket agents is only implemented for the Jetty servlet container. 
  See the Servlet Container Support Policy page for details.</p>
<h3>Pipeline</h3>
  <p>
    Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline" with a capital "P") is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.
    A continuous delivery (CD) pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your users and customers. 
    Every change to your software (committed in source control) goes through a complex process on its way to being released. 
    This process involves building the software in a reliable and repeatable manner, as well as progressing the built software (called a "build") through multiple stages of testing and deployment.
